flask-skeleton
==============

A simple skeleton for quickly setting up a flask app. Utilizes flask-classy for views and flask-sqlalchemy for the ORM.

All requirements to get up and running are included in requirements.txt

Page title is stored in a global variable before each request from an app config variable and displayed in the base template. You can add additional text after by defining title during template rendering.

Read flask-classy docs if you are unsure how flask-classy functions.
