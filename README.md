flask-skeleton
==============

A simple skeleton for quickly setting up a flask app. Utilizes flask-classy for views and flask-sqlalchemy for the ORM

All package dependencies needed to get up and running are included in requirements.txt

Version 2.0 now uses blueprints in place of flask-classy, as well as highly improved structure.
